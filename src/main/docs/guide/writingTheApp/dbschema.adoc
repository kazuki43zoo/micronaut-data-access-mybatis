Now that Mybatis is setup we need a way to create the database schema. For that we will use
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-flyway/latest/guide/index.html[Micronaut integration with
Flyway].


Add the next snippet to `build.gradle` to include the necessary dependencies:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=flyway,indent=0]
----

Configure the database migrations directory for Flyway in `application.yml`.

[source,yml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=flyway]
----

Create the file `V1__schema.sql` with the database schema creation:

[source]
.src/main/resources/databasemigrations/V1__schema.sql
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/databasemigrations/V1__schema.sql[]
----

During application startup Flyway will execute the sql file and create the schema needed for the application.
